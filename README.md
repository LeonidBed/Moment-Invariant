# Moment-Invariant
Symbolic calculation of a minimal generating set for 2D geometric moment invariants in the  Jupyter notebook file and in Maple file

## Short manual for  Jupyter notebook
 1. Install Python package **sympy** on your computer
 2. Download the file **2D_moment_invariants.ipynb** on your conputer 
 3. Open it with Jupyter
 4. Run the cell with operators --> 
 5. The procedure II(d) returns the list of minimal renerating set of 2D geometric moment invariants of order d.  Just type II(d) in a cell and then  run the cell.

 


##  Short manual for Maple
1. Download the file 2D_moment_invariants.mpl  to your Maple directory
2. Run Maple
3. Load the file by the command:
   > read "2D_moment_invariants.mpl":
4. The procedure  Min_Gen_Set(d) returns the list of minimal renerating set of 2D geometric moment invariants of order d
